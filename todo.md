- Make the lists in the stats section longer and scrollable. Include ranking and duration for all tracks included here.
- Scroll down to the timeline section of the page when the day is changed (with a click or the arrow keys) or the play button is clicked. 

- (no dependencies) Navigate through the timeline using the left and right arrow keys.

- (no dependencies) Add a header / footer with some branding to the page to make it a bit more interesting.
